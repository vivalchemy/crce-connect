  Beginning with an orphanage (BalBhavan) and a trade school in carpentry, the
  Agnel Ashram (set up in 1957 at Bandra, Mumbai) has today grown into a
  full-fledged Technical Complex. The Institute today proudly bears the
  founder's name as a fitting tribute to his impassioned faith in
  highly-qualified and fully-trained engineers and technicians in the service of
  the nation.
