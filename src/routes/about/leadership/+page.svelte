        Today's Global Education scenario is changing rapidly. Science and
        Technology are forging ahead in order to provide a world-class Education
        and sophisticated life to human beings all over the world. We stand at a
        unique moment in time and we should understand these challenges that lie
        ahead of us. With technical education at an inflection point, we must
        strive to equip technocrats of tomorrow with the competence, ability,
        and character to address emerging global business and social challenges.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Technological, corporate & social expectation changes, intense
        competition has made technical education very dynamic and unpredictable.
        With Liberalization, Privatization and Globalization World is getting
        more and more integrated and also globalized. Even technical education
        today is also energized continuously by powerful forces of change such
        as developments in science and technology. The work of Today's engineer
        is not restricted to manage only his/her product or service and market.
        Rather he/she has a large responsibility to assume the role of an
        organizational leader in such environments which is extremely
        challenging but rewarding as well. Such leaders in today's environment
        need to acquire specialized knowledge, skills, and attitudes so as to
        have a cutting edge advantage over their competitors.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        In this context, we at CRCE design our teaching-learning pedagogy with
        the belief that today's engineers need to inculcate in themselves an
        analytical orientation to understand and analyze complex technical
        situations while at the same time possess an action orientation and an
        administrative point of view.

        Conceicao Rodrigues College of Engineering: a prestigious, self-financed
        institute affiliated to University of Mumbai. Maharashtra and approved

        Engineers who can Build the Nation**' inspired by the dream of our
        founder Rev. Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues. Fr. CRCE aspires to be a center of
        excellence in engineering education, moulding engineers with the
        state-of-the art technologies, innovative skills and human values
        matching with the growing expectations of the corporates and the society
        and thus play an effective role in nation building.
