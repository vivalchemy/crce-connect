        Located in a picturesque environment in the heart of Mumbai, Fr.
        Conceicao Rodrigues College of Engineering (Fr.CRCE) is one of the
        renowned, premier and sought-after private Engineering colleges. The
        Institute is dedicated to making a difference in Engineering education,
        with its exclusive approach towards the ongoing momentum of trends in
        technology and holistic development.

        Beginning with an orphanage (BalBhavan) and a trade school in carpentry,
        the Agnel Ashram (set up in 1957 at Bandra, Mumbai) has today grown into
        a full-fledged Technical Complex. The Institute today proudly bears the
        founder's name as a fitting tribute to his impassioned faith in
        highly-qualified and fully-trained engineers and technicians in the
        service of the nation.
