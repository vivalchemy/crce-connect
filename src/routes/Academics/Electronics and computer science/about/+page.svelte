          The department was established in 1987 with B.E. in Electronics
          Engineering. From the academic year 2019-20, the course is renamed to
          Electronics and Computer Science to cope up with 4th Industrial
          revolution.

          Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies such as Artificial
          Intelligence, Genome Editing, Augmented Reality, Robotics, Internet of
          Things and 3-D printing are rapidly changing the way humans create,
          exchange and distribute resources. As in the case of previous
          revolutions, this will profoundly transform Institutions, industries,
          and individuals. The Fourth Industrial Revolution can make exponential
          changes to the way we live, work and relate to one another due to the
          adoption of cyber-physical systems, Internet of Things and Internet of
          Systems. As we implement smart technologies in our factories and
          workplaces, connected machines will interact, visualize the entire
          production chain and make decisions autonomously. This revolution is
          expected to impact all disciplines, industries, and economies. Fourth
          Industrial Revolution could create a job market that's segregated into
          "low-skill/low-pay" and "high-skill/high-pay" segments. Over the
          years, strict adherence to quality norms in teaching-learning and
          evaluation has always been the strength of the department.

          After a comprehensive study of the industry requirements as well as
          technological trends, the syllabus for the course Electronics and
          Computer Science has been framed to include courses that build a
          conceptual understanding of basics of Electronics as well as Computer
          Science. Additionally, advanced courses have been added to cover niche
          areas like Artificial intelligence and Machine Learning, Data
          Sciences, Mobile communication, VLSI, IoT, etc. A practical-oriented
          approach is being followed to make students proficient in the
          competitive industry environment as well as prepare them for higher
          education.
