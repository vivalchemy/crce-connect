          As per the World Economic Forum report, 4th Industrial revolution
          represents a fundamental change in the way we live, work, and relate
          to one another. It will impact every aspect of life by enabling smart
          technologies. To enable smart technologies, the program Incorporates a
          wide range of topics in computer engineering like Artificial
          Intelligence, Big Data Analytics, Block-Chain, Internet of Things,
          with basic technologies like computer programming, Computer Networking
          Database management system, computing Technologies, Programming
          languages, and algorithms. Department has adopted Project-based
          learning approach which helps students to explore various thrust
          application areas and apply principles of Computer technology across
          multidisciplinary field.

          The department conducts various training programs to help faculty and
          students to improve their technical knowledge. The department has
          fetched research grants from MODROB and Minor Research Grant of Mumbai
          University for Innovative Projects. It has signed MoU with several
          companies like Suven Consultant and Technology Pvt. Ltd, Indian
          Institute of Remote Sensing (IRS) Outreach Programme, crypto
          university, AWS, LPI Canada, EC council Academia, and Tata Consultancy
          Services (TCS). Graduates of our department have been recruited by
          major IT companies such as BrowserStack, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan
          Chase, ZS, TIAA, Seclore, Quantiphi, Carwale, SAP, Amdocs, TCS,
          Accenture, to name a few. Department has made conscious efforts to
          develop the department as a center of excellence in the field of
          Machine learning.

          To gain practical exposure to real-world engineering challenges,
          enhancing theoretical knowledge with hands-on applications, students
          undergo Internships which enables them to work alongside industry
          professionals, gaining valuable insights and practical skills that
          can't be learned solely in the classroom. Students have pursued
          Internships in JP Morgan, Quantiphi, TIAA, etc. Students are
          encouraged to undertake certification courses on platforms like Udemy,
          Coursera, NPTEL, and IIRS that tailor education to their career
          aspirations. Both internships and certifications not only bolster our
          student's resume but also contribute significantly to their overall
          growth as future engineers. Many students aspire to pursue higher
          studies to further their academic and career goals through admission
          to renowned universities like IIM Ahmedabad, IIM Indore, Carnegie
          Mellon University, Buffalo university, Massachusetts Institute of
          Technology, to name a few.
